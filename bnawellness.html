        <p> Before n After encourages consistent exercise by giving 
        you the best services possible to continue exercising throughout your life. 
        Eventually, we will have a South Florida gym location which will offer our services, 
        in-person and online, to the public. Currently we own a private gym that is unavailable to the public. 
        Our online presence will increase over time with the developments of our social media accounts 
        (YouTube, Instagram) and exploring revenue streams using blockchain and cryptocurrencies. With this being said, 
        there is much more to come within this year aloneâ€¦ 
        Help us spread our message,
